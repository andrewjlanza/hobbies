    <header>Soccer: "the beautiful game"</header>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I have loved sports. The excitement, the fame, and the glory all fascinated me. I knew I valued these things, but until I was much older I failed to realize what truly made me love sports. What I came to learn that I loved more than anything about sports was it’s ability to bring people together. Unlike anything in the world, sports brings people of different race, religion, and language together. With this being said, there is no sport more powerful in this regard than soccer.

Baseball was the first sport I loved. I played it the longest time of any sport I’ve played, including tee ball, little league to middle school, then high school. Along the way I learned about other sports, which dissuaded my interest from baseball as “the one and only”. The next sport that consumed my interests was American football. I played in middle school and high school. It builds chemistry among the players more than any sport I know, still to this day, which made me fall in love. However, it wasn’t until high school that I began practicing and playing soccer. That’s when my sports world changed forever. For as long as I had been following sports, there had always been one league and (for the most part) one language. Soccer introduced me to the transcendence of love for sport uniformly throughout societies that otherwise had so little in common. It is because of this that I fell in love. It is the same reason that soccer is the most practiced and followed sport in the world.
